OuiSi is a game where players arrange similar tiles next to each other based on traits such as color or shape. 
There is no winner to OuiSi, but this game framework opens possibilities for latent-space-related computer vision work to create an AI OuiSi player. 
Our goal is to create an AI OuiSi player that identifies OuiSi matches that are as good or better than a human player on average.
